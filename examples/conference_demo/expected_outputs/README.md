# Expected Output Artifacts

This directory is intentionally kept lightweight in version control.

Generated by demo run:
```bash
python examples/conference_demo/demo_runner.py --reset
```

Artifacts produced:
1. `latest_run_summary.json`
2. `latest_query_rows.json`

These files are run-specific and include generated instance/process IDs.
